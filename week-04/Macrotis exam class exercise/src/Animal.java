// -  has a `name` and stores it's health state in a boolean
// -  has a `healCost` field
// -  has a method named `heal()`, that sets the `isHealthy` field's status to true
// -  has a method named `isAdoptable` that returns a boolean value whether it can be adopted or not (an animal
//    can be adopted if it is healthy)
// -  has a method named `toString()` that represents the Animal in the following format:
// <name> is not healthy (<heal cost>â‚¬), and not adoptable
// <name> is healthy, and adoptable
// The animal's name is the same as the class name by default, but it can be set trough constructor as well
//
// We are working with 3 types of Animals
// -  Cat's healing cost should be a random number between 0 and 6
// -  Dog's healing cost should be a random number between 1 and 8
// -  Parrot's healing cost should be a random number between 4 and 10
